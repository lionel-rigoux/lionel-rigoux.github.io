My research interests are mainly focused on decision-making and energy balance (effort production & food intake), and more generally computational psychiatry and dynamical neurosciences.

For a quick illustrated introduction to my research, check my <a href="http://histoires-courtes.fr/#page=Rigoux" target="_blank">"short story"</a>. And please have a look at the <a href="http://histoires-courtes.fr" target="_blank">wonderful work</a> of Jean-François Dars and Anne Papillault for more portraits!
